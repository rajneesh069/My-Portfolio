    <h1>The Best movies according to Rajneesh</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
 
    <h3>Pirates Of The Caribbean Franchise</h3>
    <p>It is funny and adventrous. Most importantly it has supernatural elements blended in a beautiful way.
         The ships and the pirates bring back the old age times on the screen.
    And the main character Jack Sparrow, he is OG of the franchise. 
    Johnny Depp did a fantastic job in playing him.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</p>
 
    <h3>Zack Snyder's Justice League</h3>
    <p>Zack made a great 4 superhero movie. The story is so deep and fascinatingü§å.<br />
    It is about a team of supes called Justice League having Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg and Flash on the
    team.<p>They fight together against an enemy called SteppenWolf(a pawn of Darkseid, he's the main villian) who has
        come for the Mother Boxes(for simplicity think of it like the infinity stones of Marvel Universe,
         they have the
        power of Matter Manipulation and can destroy planets and universes in a matter of seconds).</p>
     </p>
 
    <h3>Iron Man</h3>
    <p>In this movie we see a guy named Tony Stark who is a billionaire, genius, philanthropist and playboy. We see him getting captured by terrorists and how he saves himself and makes a suit to get out of there.<br/>
    The movie shows how his story continues and how he as a character grows in his life and fights his enemies like a bossüòé using his suits and technology and proposes the love of his life.<br/>
    He is the reason we see MARVEL UNIVERSE today!
